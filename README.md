# 🏙️ NYC Property Data Analytics Project

This project explores property-related data from New York City to uncover insights about tax classifications, building density, square footage, and geospatial trends. It applies SQL, Python, and R to analyze and model relationships, with a focus on visual and statistical techniques. The work was completed as part of a graduate-level research project at George Mason University.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset Source**: [NYC Covered Buildings List (2020)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-covered-buildings-list-2020)
- **Goal**: Identify trends and relationships in NYC property tax classifications, land use, borough differences, and geospatial patterns.
- **Approach**: Used SQL for data ingestion and exploration, Python for univariate analysis and correlation visualization, and R for regression and clustering models.

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. Is there a correlation between tax class and number of buildings on a tax lot?
2. What is the predominant tax class across each NYC borough?
3. How does gross square footage vary by borough and building class?
4. Can clustering reveal patterns in street names, zip codes, and building density?
